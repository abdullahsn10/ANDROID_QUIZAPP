# Android_QuizApp

<h1>Quiz Application</h1>
<p>This is my first android application which is developed in JAVA. It allows the user to choose between two modes either Multiple Choice Questions or True False Questions. After that, the user must answer 4 questions in a row. The final page will show the user's result in each question and hence the total final score.</p>
